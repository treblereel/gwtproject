 * Strategy for adjusting a date.
 * <p>
 * This interface provides a common way to access many different date
 * adjustments. Examples might be an adjuster that sets the date avoiding
 * weekends, or one that sets the date to the last day of the month.
 * <p>
 * DateAdjuster is an interface and must be implemented with care
 * to ensure other classes in the framework operate correctly.
 * All instantiable implementations must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
